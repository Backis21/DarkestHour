//  This bow MG did not have a sight or even a peephole to aim through, & was instead aimed using co-driver's overhead periscope
//  Looking through that view (or while unbuttoned but that's not modelled in game), co-driver had to aim by walking tracers or round impacts onto target
//  Note that the first person camera position (set by FPCamPos) is not quite positioned where the co-driver's overhead periscope is
//  It's deliberately lowered slightly so the player can just see the MG barrel if he waggles it up
//  This is a small compromise so the player can check roughly which way his MG is facing before he begins to fire
//  Otherwise he has to open fire not knowing which way the gun is aimed, & only then can he correct the aim (so he may hit friendlies)
//  In real life he would know where the MG was pointing because he would be holding it in his hands
//  So this camera adjustment is just an effective form of substitute feedback about where the gun is pointing
