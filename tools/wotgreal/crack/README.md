# WOTgreal 3.005 Crack
Cracking WOTgreal allows the usage of the IDE's UDebugger integration, which is critical for debugging. 

## Mechanism
This crack is rudimentary, in that it simply circumvents a function that checks the validity of registration credentials into always returning true.

Unfortunately, this doesn't work across sessions, meaning that you need to "register" the program every session if you want to use the debugger. Luckily this is only a couple of keystrokes and shouldn't be a problem.

## Installation
1. Run `crack.bat` and follow the on-screen prompts.

## Usage

1. Launch the cracked version of WOTgreal 3.005.
2. Press **Shift**+**F1**.
2. Press *Register WOTgreal*.
3. Press *OK*.

You're done!

## Future Plans
In the future, I may make a legitimate key generator, since it's a pretty safe bet that the key is being generated based on the   registration e-mail.

Have fun!
