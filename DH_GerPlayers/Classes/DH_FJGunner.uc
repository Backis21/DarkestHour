    InfoText="The machine-gunner is tasked with the tactical employment of the light machine gun to provide direct fire support to his squad, and in many cases being its primary source of mid- and long-range firepower. Due to the light machine gun's high rate of fire, an adequate supply of ammunition is needed to maintain a constant rate of fire, provided largely by his accompanying units."
